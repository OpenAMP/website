# Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

# Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

# Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

# Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

# Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the OpenAMP Code of Conduct Team at [openamp-coc@lists.openampproject.org](mailto:openamp-coc@lists.openampproject.org). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The conduct team will make every effort to hear and understand all parties in the dispute. The conduct team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Confidentiality of the person in violation and the nature of the violation will be maintained until action is agreed to. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of unacceptable behavior. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom weâ€™ve received unacceptable behavior complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of OpenAMP members or the general public. We will not name victims without their affirmative consent.

Any action by the conduct team must be agreed by a majority of the members.  The conduct team will inform the person in violation of the intended action before taking action but the action will proceed with or without acknowledgment.

The OpenAMP Code of Conduct Team will report on a yearly basis the number of incidence reports. The OpenAMP Code of Conduct Team shall consist of three members elected by the community every two years or when needed.
