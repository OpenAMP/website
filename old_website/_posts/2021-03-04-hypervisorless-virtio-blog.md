Dan Milea from Wind River has written a blog post "Hypervisor-less virtio: Assembling Multi-OS systems using standards-based protocols for intra-SoC connectivity and device sharing".

Summary:
Hypervisor-less virtio can complement and enhance the OpenAMP RPMsg framework by providing communication and resource sharing between a rich execution environment like Linux, running the Physical Machine Monitor (PMM) software and acting as the OpenAMP master, and an application specific real-time or safety island deployed on the remote processor.
By eliminating the hypervisor, a “lateral” communication framework like hypervisor-less virtio enables role assignments (similar to OpenAMP master and remote) based on application requirements and the ability of each of the runtimes to support the PMM.
