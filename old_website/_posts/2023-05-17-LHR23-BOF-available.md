The Heterogenous Processing Project (HPP) and OpenAMP System Reference working group held a Birds of Feather discussion at Linaro Connect LHR23 on April 27, 2023.  

This BOF was open to discussions about all things AMP. Many modern SOCs contain multiple CPU types. Many system solutions use multiple different operating systems like Linux + RTOS.

The presentation consisted of a short introduction and status update, followed by open discussion with the audience. All topics related to this scope were welcome.

Discussion leads:
* Bill Mills, Principal Technical Consultant, Linaro
* Arnaud Pouliquen, Design S/W Senior Engineer, STMicroelectronics
* Tomas Evensen, Senior Fellow Open Source Program Office, AMD Xilinx
* Dan Milea, Technology Office, Wind River
* Mathieu Poirier, Kernel Maintainer, Linaro
* Nathalie Chan King Choy, Open Source Program Manager, AMD Xilinx

The video of the presentation and the slides can be found [at this Linaro resource page](https://resources.linaro.org/en/resource/ivxrQF2tyyQcQEoBCkMCM4).
