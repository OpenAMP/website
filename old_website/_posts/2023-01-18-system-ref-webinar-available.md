The Heterogenous Processing Project (HPP) and OpenAMP System Reference working group webinar was on December 13, 2022.  The video and supporting materials are posted to the Linaro resources page.

The webinar covered progress that has been made over the last 3 years with a special focus on current work.  

Three areas were highlighted:
* Upstream build and use with the Linux kernel and Zephyr
* Virtio devices other than rpmsg on CPU cores that do not share a hypervisor
* System Devicetree hands-on with the Looper tool

Each area has slides, a demo, and links to resources that attendees can use to reproduce the demos on their own and try things out after the event.  

Speakers and Panelists:
* Bill Mills, Principal Technical Consultant, Linaro
* Arnaud Pouliquen, Design S/W Senior Engineer, STMicroelectronics
* Tanmay Shah, Sr. Software Development Engineer, AMD Xilinx
