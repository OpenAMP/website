It is not a requirement to be employed at a Member company to participate as a developer or in the OpenAMP Technical Steering Committee. Community participation is welcome!

Governance of the community project is overseen by a board of representatives from Member companies. Member fees support administration for the project, such as the project website and mailing lists. Details of the Governance are in the [Project Charter](/docs/OpenAMPProject_Charter_Approved2020Mar06BoardMeeting.pdf).
